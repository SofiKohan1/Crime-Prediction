# Crime-Prediction

The application of data science tools and technologies has become very broad. All these applications aim towards the solution of people's problems or needs (Costa 2020). One problem to be solved is to predict possible future crimes and prevent them when possible by law enforcement agencies, 'to identify likely targets for police intervention and prevent crime or solve past crimes by making statistical predictions' (Perry el al. 2013).
Los Angeles Police Department uses spatial prediction to allocate patrols and has decreased crimes by 5.4% and homicides by 22.6%(Uchida et al., 2012). The systems involve using algorithms to analyze massive amounts of historical and real-time data to predict and help prevent future events. Generally, the systems fall within two categories: place-based and person-based predictive policing.
In this report, an experiment on crime data under the category of place-based predictive policing will be carried out on the San Francisco P.D Dataset with the following objectives:
  • To perform an exploratory data analysis to gain insights about crimes and to map crime hotspots in San Francisco
  • To develop predictive models to determine in which police district a crime may fall within
  • To critically analyze the performance of the models and determine whether the system will provide
  insights for law enforcement officers or not
